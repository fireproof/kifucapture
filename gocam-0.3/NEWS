GoCam NEWS -- history of user-visible changes

-- Version 0.2 --
				
GoCam reimplemented in C++.  The system is able to find the playing
grid, but no stone detection implemented yet.  The modules of the
system are defined neatly in separate namespaces and documented with
Doxygen.  The namespaces are

  * gocam:	the main analysis
  * geom:	line and point geometry in two dimensions
  * im:		general image processing functions

and some common utility functions not related to analysis
'
  * conf:	general functions for parsing program configuration options
  * str:	handy functions for handling strings
  * util:	common utility functions

The namespaces are defined in header files of the same name (appended
with the .hh extension)


-- Version 0.1 --

The first prototype version implemented in MATLAB.  Finds the grid
from still images, and has a simple algorithm for locating stones.
