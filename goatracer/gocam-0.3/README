GoCam - A computer vision tool for extracting moves from go videos

GoCam is an open source project for developing an automatic system for
analysing video capture of a real go game, and extracting the moves of
the game.  More information about the project can be found on the
project's wiki page "http://teemu.pieni.net/gocam-wiki/moin.cgi".  See
"NEWS" file for general changes, and "INSTALL" file for compilation
and installation instructions.

The system can be experimented with the command line tool "gocam_test"
and the example image "example.jpg".  Just give the image as a command
line parameter:

  ./gocam_test example.jpg

Analysing images may take 1-30 seconds depending on the speed of your
computer and the size of the images.  After analysis, the program
opens a window showing the original image and the grid it found.  At
the moment, the program does not try to find stones on the board.

The test program recognises also some command line options:

  -h, --help             display help
  -i, --intermediate     show also intermediate results
  -s, --save-hough=FILE  save the hough image
  -u, --use-hough=FILE   load a pre-computed hough image
