Things to think about 

Maybe SenchaTouch is the way to go?

*** Javascript in sep. files?

Eidogo - SGF playback.

Create directories
	/tmp for storing in-progress SGF files
	Settings - current SGF header values (settings.txt)
	Directory for each saved game - settings.txt, SGF.txt, preview.png?
view directories + contents as list (review/download past games)
	File listing
		Tap on file needs "selected" style
		Delete button needs confirmation
			Can't add new files after deleting?
		Open - shows details, briefly. WTF?
		Needs: Email, View
