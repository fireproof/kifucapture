WTF is up with image sizes?

Eidogo: loading data into hidden div? initGame hook to load as the game progresses?

jhead (or other EXIF rotation fix) will be necessary.

Things to think about 

Create directories
	/tmp for storing in-progress SGF files
	Settings - current SGF header values (settings.txt)
	Directory for each saved game - settings.txt, SGF.txt, preview.png?
view directories + contents as list (review/download past games)
	File listing
		Tap on file needs "selected" style
		Delete button needs confirmation
			Can't add new files after deleting?
		Open - shows details, briefly. WTF?
		Needs: Email, View
