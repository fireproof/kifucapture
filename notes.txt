WTF is up with image sizes?
	read up on canvas and images and all that shit.

Eidogo: loading data into hidden div? initGame hook to load as the game progresses?

jhead (or other EXIF rotation fix) will be necessary.

PhoneGap plugin - making one
	http://wiki.phonegap.com/w/page/36753496/How%20to%20Create%20a%20PhoneGap%20Plugin%20for%20iOS


NativeControls plugin
	toolbar / tabbar (or action sheet?)
	https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/blob/master/iOS/NativeControls/NativeControls.js


BUGS:
  spinner don't spin
  Tilt counter clock-wise causes flip! EXIF? Check on code in goatracer...
  
  New Capture step at launch?
    save existing, continue, or new capture? -- a good point to select camera or photolibrary?
    
  Camera button should just launch camera.
  
  Eidogo - how to load new moves progressively?
  
  Select 
  
  TABLE STRUCTURE
    moves uniqID gameID moveID(for sequence) move (coordinates or SGF)
    
    gameID date, other preamble stuff
    
    preferences
------------
Things to think about 

Create directories
	/tmp for storing in-progress SGF files
	Settings - current SGF header values (settings.txt)
	Directory for each saved game - settings.txt, SGF.txt, preview.png?
view directories + contents as list (review/download past games)
	File listing
		Tap on file needs "selected" style
		Delete button needs confirmation
			Can't add new files after deleting?
		Open - shows details, briefly. WTF?
		Needs: Email, View
